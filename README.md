## Setup Instructions and File Run Order
### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/STOCK_PREDICTION.git
cd STOCK_PREDICTION
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv stock_prediction_venv
source stock_prediction_venv/bin/activate   # On Mac/Linux
stock_prediction_venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Download Data
```bash
python src/data/download_data.py
```

### 5. Run Data Preprocessing
```bash
python src/preprocess/preprocess.py
```

### 6. Feature Engineering
```bash
python src/features/technical_indicators.py
```

### 7. Further Preprocess
```bash
python src/preprocess/further_preprocess.py
python src/preprocess/further_preprocess2.py
```

### After Preprocessing, data analyse code can be runned to inspect the dataset health.

## Evaluation Report
- ðŸ“Š Final Model Evaluation Metrics:
- ðŸ“‰ Training MAE: 0.0570
- ðŸ“Š Validation MAE: 0.0432
- ðŸ“ˆ Test MAE: 0.0274
- ðŸ“‰ Test RMSE: 0.0353
- ðŸ“Š Test MAPE: 4.51%
- ðŸ“ˆ Test RÂ² Score: 0.9749

### Results Summary
- The model achieved exceptional performance, as evidenced by the following metrics:

- Test MAE: 0.0274: On average, the model's predictions are off by 0.0274 units from the actual closing prices, indicating high accuracy.

- Test RMSE: 0.0353: Larger errors are minimal, with a root mean squared error of 0.0353, showing consistency in predictions.

- Test MAPE: 4.51%: The model's predictions are, on average, 4.51% off from the actual values, which is highly competitive for stock price forecasting.

- Test RÂ²: 0.9749: The model explains 97.49% of the variance in the closing prices, demonstrating its ability to capture almost all underlying patterns in the data.
